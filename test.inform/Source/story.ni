the office is a room.


A television is a kind of device.

A television has a number called the channel. Understand the channel property as referring to a television. Understand "channel" as a television.

Changing the channel of it to is an action applying to one thing and one number.

Understand "tune [television] to [channel]" or "change channel of [television] to [channel]" as changing the channel of it to.

Understand "tune [something] to [channel]" or "change channel of [something] to [channel]" as changing the channel of it to.

Understand "tune to [channel] on [television]" or "change to [channel] on [television]" as changing the channel of it to (with nouns reversed).

Understand "tune to [channel] on [something]" or "change to [channel] on [something]" as changing the channel of it to (with nouns reversed).

Understand "[number]" or "channel [number]" as "[channel]".

Check changing the channel of something to: 
	if the noun is not a television, say "[The noun] cannot be tuned to a channel." instead.

Carry out changing the channel of something to: 
	now the channel of the noun is the number understood.

Report changing the channel of something to: 
	say "You tune [the noun] to channel [number understood]."


Instead of examining a television:
	if the noun is switched off, say "[The noun] is currently turned off." instead;
	let the chosen channel be the channel of the noun;
	if the chosen channel is a current channel listed in the Table of Television Channels:
		choose row with current channel of the chosen channel in the Table of Television Channels;
		say "[output entry][paragraph break]"; 
	otherwise:
		say "Snow fills the screen of [the noun]."

Table of Television Channels
